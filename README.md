# Naginie

Naginie is a mini-CMS based on python / flask / sqlalchemy, aimed to easily deploy content-managed websites through organized directories and files and assigning properties to the said directories and files. For example, a directory can be a blog while the other one can be just the footer navigation. 

## Status ##
It's still early stage and **Naginie is not usable at the moment**.

## History ##
I made a flask based CMS a long time ago and this is the 2020 version of my old CMS: [FyPress](https://github.com/Fy-/FyPress). I was tired of WordPress and I plan on developing tools to migrate from WP to Naginie in the future.
