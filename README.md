# Naginie

Naginie is a mini-CMS based on python / flask / sqlalchemy, aimed to easily deploy content-managed websites through organized directories and files and assigning properties to these directories and files. For exemple a directory can be a blog while an other one can be just the footer navigation. It's the 2020 version of my old CMS: [FyPress](https://github.com/Fy-/FyPress) and it's not usable at the moment.
